1 i%1:10:00:: would put%2:35:05:: the hitachi up%4:02:03:: with the best%5:00:00:advisable:00 ! .
1 no vibration%1:04:00:: ! .
1 smooth%3:00:02:: plunging ! . ( it do%2:42:02:: stick%2:35:04:: a bit%1:06:01:: so%4:02:02:: i%5:00:00:cardinal:00 spray%2:35:03:: it w/ lubricant%1:27:00:: .
1 it be%2:41:00:: a great%5:00:00:uppercase:00 router%1:06:00:: for a table%1:14:01:: and with the depth%1:26:00:: adjustment%1:11:00:: knob%1:06:00:: it be%2:41:00:: easy%5:00:00:available:00 to adjust%2:30:03:: depth%1:26:00:: precisely%4:02:02:: .

1 very good%5:00:00:ample:00 balance%1:21:00:: in the hand%1:08:00:: and light%5:00:00:thin:01 than most%3:00:02:: 3 1/4 hp%1:23:00:: model%1:09:00:: .
1 the soft%3:00:00:: start%1:15:00:: be%2:42:06:: nice%3:00:00:: .
1 the price%1:21:00:: be%2:42:02:: incredible%3:00:00:: with the bonus%1:21:00:: pack%1:06:03:: and hitachi 's $25 incentive%1:16:00:: ( you need%2:34:00:: the code%1:10:01:: -- -go to tool%2:38:00:: seeker%1:06:00:: . com and it tell%2:32:08:: you )
1 the total%5:00:00:whole:00 price%1:21:00:: with delivery%1:11:00:: ( free%3:00:02:: shipping%1:04:00:: ) be%2:42:06:: $135 ! .
1 less%3:00:00:: than a cheap%5:00:00:inferior:02 cordless drill%1:06:00:: or a laminate trimmer%1:06:00:: .
1 saw%2:35:00:: the hitachi on amazon%1:17:00:: . com with their $25 . 00 coupon%1:10:00:: ( at the time%1:03:00:: ) and could not%4:02:00:: resist%2:33:00:: try%2:37:00:: it out .
1 unlike other%5:00:02:past:00 reviewer%1:18:01:: i like the tool%1:06:00:: because it be%2:42:02:: easy%5:00:00:abundant:00 to operate%2:35:00:: outside of the router%1:06:01:: table%1:14:00:: .
1 both the on/off switch%1:06:00:: ( soft%3:00:03:: start%1:15:00:: ) and the depth%1:15:00:: lock%1:08:00:: be%2:42:02:: within easy%5:00:00:available:00 reach%1:15:00:: of the right%3:00:00:: hand%1:08:00:: .
1 it be%2:41:00:: no more%4:02:00:: heavy%5:00:00:full:00 than any other%3:00:00:: powerful%5:00:01:strong:00 router%1:06:01:: and not%4:02:00:: as%4:02:00:: bad%5:00:00:evil:00 as some porter%1:18:04:: cable%1:06:02:: model%1:09:02:: i try%2:41:05:: .
1 for me it be%2:42:03:: as%4:02:00:: important%3:00:02:: that the tool%1:06:00:: be%2:42:03:: comfortable%5:00:00:sufficient:00 to use%2:34:01:: as it be%2:42:03:: that it produce%2:36:02:: a high-quality result%1:10:01:: .
1 can recommend%2:32:01:: the hitachi in this ergonomic%3:01:00:: arena%1:26:00:: -- at the price%1:21:00:: quote%2:32:13:: on amazon%1:17:00:: it be%2:41:00:: a bargain%1:21:01:: .
1 after get%2:39:13:: use%2:34:01:: to the m12 all the rest%1:26:00:: seem%2:39:02:: lack%2:42:00:: .
1 on top%1:06:01:: of be%2:41:00:: a workhorse%1:05:00:: and ultra%5:00:00:immoderate:00 reliable it be%2:41:00:: just%4:02:03:: a plunge%1:11:00:: router%1:06:00:: that work%2:41:05:: really%4:02:02:: well%4:02:00:: .
1 i%1:10:00:: use%2:41:03:: it in the table%1:13:01:: ( never%4:02:00:: take%2:38:09:: the spring%1:28:00:: out - just%4:02:03:: attach%2:35:02:: the fine%5:00:00:thin:01 adjustment%1:04:00:: knob%1:06:00:: ) in my woo drat and freehand and it work%2:38:02:: great%5:00:01:extraordinary:00 in all circumstance%1:26:02:: .

1 the depth%1:15:00:: adjustment%1:04:00:: and bit%1:06:02:: changing be%2:42:03:: much easy%5:00:00:available:00 on the m12v than it be%2:42:03:: on my old%5:00:00:early:01 router%1:06:01:: .
1 the handle%1:06:00:: make%2:42:11:: it very comfortable%3:00:00:: to use%2:34:01:: and i experience%1:09:01:: little%3:00:00:: vibration%1:11:00:: .
